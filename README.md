# upload_file_to_ipfs
i can use react as a frontend and pinata to store file.
first you need to register and login in pinata and afterwards you need to create api at that time they provide some keys so u need to save it.
this link is used to connect to pinata
you need to create env file to give that keys
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY="your_pinata_api_key"
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_SECRET="your_pinata_api_secret_key"
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_pinata_acess_token"
